Project 1 for Bootcamp: DATA-PT-EAST-APRIL-041524-MTTH.
Country Life Expectancy
Collaborators - Ethan Tebbe, Stephen Ferrier, Ayannah Clouden, Sarah Ruth, and Spencer Garrett.

  For Project 1, Group 4 worked with a dataset from Kaggle titled “Country Life Expectancy.”  The dataset was initially cleaned and a csv file was created. We all used Python via Jupyter Notebook to analyze the data and create visualizations based off the research questions each collaborator found interest in.
