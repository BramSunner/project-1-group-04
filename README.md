# About the Project
This is a data analysis project on a kaggle dataset titled "Country Life Expectancy".  

Our team found a dataset and created a project proposal.


Then, our team cleaned the CSV file and moved on to analysis.  
Each team member created a research question and analyzed it.  
Here is an overview of the questions (and subsequent folders those questions are analyzed in):
1. Smoking Deaths vs. Life Expectancy (ethan_work)
2. Suicide Deaths vs. GDP, Suicide Deaths vs. Schooling (sarah_work)
3. Obesity Deaths vs. GDP (ayannah_work)
4. GDP vs. Life Expectancy (spencer_work)
5. Schooling vs. Life Expectancy (stephen_work)


Our official writeup in the written_work folder contains the findings on this project.

Collaborators - Ethan Tebbe, Stephen Ferrier, Ayannah Clouden, Sarah Ruth, and Spencer Garrett.

  For Project 1, Group 4 worked with a dataset from Kaggle titled “Country Life Expectancy.”  The dataset was initially cleaned and a csv file was created. We all used Python via Jupyter Notebook to analyze the data and create visualizations based off the research questions each collaborator found interest in.
